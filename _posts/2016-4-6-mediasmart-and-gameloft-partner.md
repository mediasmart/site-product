Gameloft Advertising Solutions has partnered with mediasmart Mobile – a company that licenses its leading mobile DSP (Demand Side Platform), helping its clients optimize their mobile media buying process – to make Gameloft inventory programmatically available through mediasmart’s bsmart platform.

This is one of the first partnerships that Gameloft Advertising Solutions signs directly with a DSP, and in the first phase Gameloft Advertising Solutions’ inventory will only be available in bsmart via private deals.

mediasmart clients will now have access to a global inventory of more than 8 billion impressions and a reach of 166 million global unique users each month. Adding this premium inventory to bsmart´s proven capabilities in audience and predictive targeting, gives brands the ability to maximize the reach and effectiveness of their mobile campaigns, while protecting their brand integrity.

“With over 21 million daily active users, Gameloft, via Gameloft Advertising Solutions, has complete ownership of its inventory and offers 100% viewability, as well as complete transparency for bsmart users.” says Cyril Guilleminot, Director for France & Benelux at Gameloft.

>> “We are thrilled to partner with Mediasmart to allow advertisers and agencies to safely reach their mobile audiences in a transparent and engaging environment with video and display formats.”

“mediasmart is a trusted provider to customers in more than 15 countries across EMEA and America, all of whom use our platform in a self-serve mode” says Noelia Amoedo, CEO of mediasmart, “We are dedicated to providing our customers with not only the best mobile technology, but also the best available mobile inventory. This partnership is yet another step in that direction.”
